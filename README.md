# DankMaterialShell (dms)

If you want details on the original, you can find them [here](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell)

## Why did I fork?

After I am finished working out these details, I will submit them for review on the main fork. If all of the changes I want to see are fit for the main branch, this branch will archive. If not, it will continue to exist as a more highly configurable version of DMS, which I will try to keep up to date with the main fork as much as is possible.

## What am I adding to DMS?

- More configuration options in the settings modal, namely:
  - [ ] Corner radius
  - [ ] Easing/animation curve settings
- I also want to fix a couple of bugs, such as:
  - [ ] Fixing the default user matugen configs so they link properly to the .config directory in home when parsed by the `matugen-worker`
  - [ ] Allowing more customization in the appearance of the workspace switcher (length/height of pills, etc.)
  - [ ] Allowing some popouts/slideins (notepad, tabs in DankDash, etc.) to match animation speed with the rest of DMS

This list may increase as I use DMS more, as I learned about it fairly recently.
